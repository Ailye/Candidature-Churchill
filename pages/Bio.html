Openness must be an indispensable quality of a man, especially if he has the responsibility to command other men.

But, in addition he tried when it was possible to make the least possible victims. The lives of his men made sense to him. Once under heavy fire from the enemy, without a helmet and on top of a knoll, in sight of the enemy, he led the retreat of the troops of our company. Here is his courage and luck!</P>
